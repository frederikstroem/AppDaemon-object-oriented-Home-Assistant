# AppDaemon [Python] object oriented [OOP] Home Assistant
This is a snapshot [2023-06-15] of some of my work on an AppDaemon [Python] object-oriented (OOP) Home Assistant setup. I've also set up simple continuous deployment (CD) ⚙️ using a hacky Git 🐙, Rust 🦀 Actix-web backend, and webhooks 🎣 for this part. This seems necessary because AppDaemon's hot reload appears to be broken when running this type of OOP setup, requiring a complete restart of AppDaemon. 🫠

Feel free to *use*, *copy*, *modify*, *share* and *train* upon this code however you like.
